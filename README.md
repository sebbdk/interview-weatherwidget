Weather app
================

A simple weather app build for as a demo of what i can do for an interview.

# App requirements
The this app was build with the following software in mind:

NPM version >= 6.4.1
Node.js version >= v10.11.0

It might work with versions lesser than this, but it is untested.

# How to run this
Assuming you have npm/node installed clone the repository to a folder and run this command:
´npm run build:serve´

This will build the application and serve it on `http://127.0.0.1:8081`.
